# nextcloudx
Nextcloud extended with libreoffice, imagemagick and ghostscript for file previews

## Usage

Please refer to [nextcloud/docker](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker) for setup references.
This image is only extended with the mentioned packages to enable previews for more file types
"out of the box". You need to enable certain file types explicitly in your ``config.php``, see
[Configuration Parameters](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html#previews)
for references.
